## Project display

"The COGIP is a company which we donâ€™t know an all lot about apart that they produce Jean-Michel toys and do Pokemon exchange. They also have incredible employees within their rank."

"Jean-Christian Ranu works in accounting at the COGIP. He has been using an old, ugly and incomplete software for years, making him go between it and excels sheet. Jean-Christian like paella, crosswords and his coworker Muriel Perrache."

What the .... is this project presentation ^^


The goal of this project is to increase our knowledge of php, connection to databases and teamwork.

## Progress of the project

We started with an understanding of the MVC model in php, apart from Nassim, Mathieu and I were not the most comfortable with it.

Then we started with the database and what we needed.

Then we started coding :

    -   We did the router first
    -   A first page of connection as well as the dashboard
    -   The lists
    -   Functions (add, edit, del)
    -   The details of the views
    -   The design
